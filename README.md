# Artificial Neural Network on Bank Dataset (Python)

I have developed a Artificial Neural Network on a Bank Customer Dataset where I predicted on the given parameters that the customer will leave the bank or not. The batch size used is of size 10 observation and no of epochs used is 100. The accuracy of the model is **86%**.
